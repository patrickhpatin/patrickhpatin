							<p>
								I have been a software developer in Atlanta for over 25 years. But I haven't always been from Atlanta or even the USA. In fact, I was born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1969. My family relocated from Germany to Atlanta on February 10, 1982, when I was 11 years old. Shortly after that we moved to Anniston, AL where I attended and graduated from Saks High School. I started college at OU in Norman, OK but finished my degree in Archaeology at the University of Alabama.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have held several jobs since then, almost all were in Atlanta. However, I have lived and worked in Belgium at Euroclear and in Wichita, KS at Paradigm.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have also been a mountaineering guide, rock climbing instructor, search and rescue for TAG and I currently teach kids how to mountain bike.
